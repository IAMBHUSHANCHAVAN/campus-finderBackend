# Campus-finder Backend

This repository contains the backend code for Campus Finder, a platform that helps students find and explore various schools, colleges, and investors. The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB and utilizes various npm packages for its functionality. The backend provides features like user authentication, review management, profile editing, and CRUD APIs for colleges and schools. Additionally, certain features are restricted to the admin only, such as deleting or inserting colleges and schools, as well as editing existing entries.

## Getting Started

To use this backend, follow the steps below:
1. Clone the project repository using the following command:`git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required packages:`npm i`
3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. Inside the .env file, add the following **env variables**:`PORT=`,<br>`CONNECTION_STRING=YOUR_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING`, <br>`JWT_SECRET=`, <br>`JWT_EXPIRE=`, <br>`COOKIE_EXPIRE=`
4. After setting up the .env file and installing the dependencies, you can start the server by running:
**`npm start`**.

The API should now be up and running, ready to serve incoming requests.

## To check api
If you are using the Thunder client to test the API, you can import the **api_collection.json** file provided in this repository. The collection contains sample API requests that you can use to interact with the backend.
